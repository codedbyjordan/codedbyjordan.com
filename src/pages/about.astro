  <div class="flex flex-col gap-8 md:text-lg">
    <p>I'm a 20 year-old software enginner currently working at <a href="https://heirloom.io" target="_blank" class="styled-link">Heirloom</a>, and doing contract work for <a href="https://heirloom.io" target="_blank" class="styled-link">Franklin</a>. I have been programming since I was eleven and have experience using numerous web technologies such as TypeScript, React, Svelte, Next.js, Tailwind, Astro, and more.</p>
    <p>I have a love for all things programming, vintage computing, and 3D printing. On my blog I try to showcase these passions by writing about my journeys exploring the topics, along with other interests including mental health.</p>
